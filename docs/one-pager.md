# Progrezz – Product One-Pager

## Snapshot

- **What it is:** AI-native study hub that turns dense readings (PDFs, web links) into interactive learning assets—quizzes, flashcards, essay drills, PDF chat, and the new **visual mind maps**.
- **Who it serves:** Students, tutors, cohort-based bootcamps, and academic support teams who need rapid content personalization without authoring overhead.
- **Value prop:** Upload once, generate many. Progrezz keeps every output aligned with the learner's weaknesses, tracks usage tokens, and syncs progress inside a unified "Student Hub."

## The Problem

Digital classrooms exploded, but study prep is still manual. Instructors spend hours turning PDFs into quizzes and visual aids, while students juggle disjointed tools, forget where their weak spots are, and rarely collaborate outside live sessions. Sharing assessments is clunky—there’s no effortless way to publish a quiz link, collect attempts, and spot trends without duct taping spreadsheets.

## Our Solution

1. **Auto-Built Study Kits**  
   Feed Progrezz any PDF or link and instantly spin up quizzes, flashcards, essay drills, and highly visual mind maps. The platform remembers every miss, so regenerated content focuses on the exact gaps.

2. **Visual Knowledge Maps**  
   Learners explore topics through color-coded, left-to-right mind maps with expandable layers. Great for workshops, async review, and quick “why this matters” storytelling.

3. **Sharable Quizzes with Live Results**  
   Every quiz can be published with a unique share code. Anyone can take it—no account needed—while the creator watches results roll in, compares cohorts, and exports leaderboards.

4. **Unified Student Hub**  
   Projects organize uploads, generated content, and PDF chats in one feed. Job notifications and suggested next steps keep learners moving without nudges from an instructor.

5. **Feedback-Aware Learning Loop**  
   Automated reminders resurface weak topics, mind maps include actionable next steps, and instructors always know which concepts need reinforcement.

## What We’re Looking For

- **Feedback** from educators, cohort operators, and learning designers to prioritize the next wave of templates.
- **Partners** (bootcamps, tutoring networks, academic success centers) who want to co-launch sharable quiz galleries and mind map libraries.
- **Customers** ready to onboard their students: we can provision projects, share demo quiz codes, and tailor onboarding in under a week.
- **Investors** excited about AI-native learning platforms that convert static readings into collaborative study rituals.

**Next step:** Request a demo kit with live mind map examples plus a sharable quiz code your team can try immediately.
