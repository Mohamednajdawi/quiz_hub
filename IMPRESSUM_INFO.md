# Impressum Information Required

## What is an Impressum?

An Impressum is a statement of ownership and authorship required by Austrian law (and German law) for websites. It must include specific information about the website owner.

## Required Information

You need to update the Impressum section in `quiz_frontend/components/Footer.tsx` with the following information:

### 1. Company/Individual Information
- **Company Name** (or your full name if individual)
- **Street Address**
- **Postal Code and City**
- **Country** (Austria)

### 2. Contact Information
- **Email Address** (for contact)
- **Phone Number** (optional but recommended)

### 3. Legal Information
- **UID (VAT) Number** - Austrian tax identification number
- **Company Register Number** - If registered as a company
- **Responsible Person** - Name of person responsible for content

### 4. Additional Requirements (if applicable)
- **Chamber Membership** - If member of a professional chamber
- **Supervisory Authority** - If applicable to your business type

## Where to Update

Edit the file: `quiz_frontend/components/Footer.tsx`

Look for the section marked with `{/* TODO: Replace with actual company information */}` and replace the placeholder text with your actual information.
